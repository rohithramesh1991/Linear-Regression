# Linear-Regression
Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on a topic of interest. The process of performing a regression allows you to confidently determine which factors matter most, which factors can be ignored, and how these factors influence each other.
It is the study of linear, additive relationships between variables. The linear regression model has a dependent variable that is a continuous variable, while the independent variables can take any form (continuous, discrete, or indicator variables).
